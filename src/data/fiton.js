          We make it easy for users to invite their friends by connecting to their Facebook account & phone's contact list. Understanding that the user‚Äôs motivation may drop in the middle of the session out of discomfort, we turned the session screen into a live call/chat room in which social interaction feeds the physical effort. A dedicated ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù tab with photos, notification & leaderboard keeps users engaged with their friends' progress and gears them up for healthy competition.

          Keeping a good work-out streak is not an easy task. That's why it's important to celebrate every effort and keep users committed to their programs. With that in mind, we crafted a whole collection of achievement badges that are visually fun and appealing to earn as recognition & reward.
